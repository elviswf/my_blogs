Recently I hang much with Ubuntu because I am trying some interesting computer vision projects which are developed in Linux environment. In addition Steam supports to play Sid Meier's Civilization V using its SteamOS platform, which means that I do not have to log into Windows to play my favourite computer game. In the purpose of using Ubuntu well, I have learn much from some websites that I have listed following.

1. [The Linux Command Line](http://linuxcommand.org/index.php)

    Designed for the new command line user, this 540-page volume covers the same material as LinuxCommand.org but in much greater detail. In addition to the basics of command line use and shell scripting, The Linux Command Line includes chapters on many common programs used on the command line, as well as more advanced topics.

    A very useful Chinese version can be found at [快乐的 Linux 命令行](http://billie66.github.io/TLCL/).

2. [LinuxTOY](https://linuxtoy.org/)

    This is a websites in Chinese that provide visitors with Linux OS related information. The website was started back in 2006. There are many useful and interesting posts, including news, softwares, games and tutorials.

3. [Ubuntu Official Website](https://www.ubuntu.com/global)

    Ubuntu is an open source project that develops and maintains a cross-platform, open-source operating system based on Debian. It includes Unity, a consistent user interface for the smartphone, the tablet and the PC. Upgrades are released every six months and support is guaranteed by Canonical for up to five years. Canonical also provides commercial support for Ubuntu deployments across the desktop, the server and the cloud.
